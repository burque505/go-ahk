# go-ahk
## Future home of go-ahk. Uses go-ole to wrap AutoHotkey.dll ##
There is initial support for most AutoHotkey.dll methods.
You will not *need* this package to access AutoHotkey.dll. You can do everything this package does with [go-ole](https://github.com/go-ole/go-ole). No files yet, sorry!
