# go-ahk
## Future home of go-ahk. Uses go-ole to wrap AutoHotkey.dll ##

*Windows only*. (Tested on Win10 Pro, but should work on Win7+.) 

Go version: 1.17.5

There is initial support for most AutoHotkey.dll methods.
You will not *need* this package to access AutoHotkey.dll. You can do everything this package does with [go-ole](https://github.com/go-ole/go-ole). No files yet, sorry!

This package targets [AutoHotkey.dll v.1](https://github.com/HotKeyIt/ahkdll-v1-release/archive/master.zip).

### I will also provide a few gists of examples without this package for those inclined to experiment ###
